# Pig Game

Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a six-faced die, and they can either accumulate their points for the turn or hold to add their current turn score to their total score. Rolling a 1 will end the player's turn and forfeit any points accumulated for that turn.

## Rules

1. The game starts with a score of 0 for both players.
2. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, accumulating points equal to the number rolled on each turn.
3. If a player rolls a 1, they score no points for that turn and it becomes the other player's turn.
4. A player can choose to hold their current score, adding their accumulated points to their total score. This ends their turn and it becomes the other player's turn.
5. The first player to reach a total score of 100 points wins the game.
